# Inventory-management
🗃️ Inventory Management System (Console-Based)

A simple and interactive **Inventory Management System** built using Python. This CLI-based project helps users add, remove, update, and view items in an inventory with ease.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add items to the inventory
- ❌ Remove items from the inventory
- ✏️ Update item quantity and price
- 📄 View all inventory items
- 🚪 Exit the program

## 🛠️ How It Works

On running the script, users are presented with a menu to select the desired operation. The inventory is maintained as a dictionary in memory, where each item is associated with its quantity and price.

```
Welcome to the Inventory Management System
Please select an option from the menu
```

### Sample Menu:

```
1. Add item to inventory  
2. Remove item from inventory  
3. Update item in inventory  
4. View inventory  
5. Exit  
```

## 📦 Example

```
Enter your choice: 1  
Enter the item name: Pens  
Enter the item quantity: 10  
Enter the item price per unit: 5.5  
Pens added.
```
